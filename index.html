                <strong>The uncomfortable truth:</strong> In Des Moines, 3 dental practices monopolize 67% of all emergency searches. 
                While they're turning patients away, 24 other practices fight for scraps.

                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> Hijack every "tooth pain," "emergency dentist," and "root canal" search in your area.</p>
                <p><strong>How it works:</strong> While competitors waste money on "dentist," we target people actively experiencing dental problems.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Your practice shows up first when someone's in pain at 3 AM.</p>

                <h3>Pain-Point Landing Pages</h3>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> Custom pages that speak directly to specific dental emergencies.</p>
                <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Someone searches "severe tooth pain" ‚Üí lands on "STOP TOOTH PAIN IN 30 MINUTES" page</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> 35-47% of visitors call immediately (vs 2% on generic dental sites)</p>

                <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Lead submits form ‚Üí immediate text with your emergency line ‚Üí follow-up call in 3 minutes</p>

        <h2>What Skeptical Des Moines Dentists Ask</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why should I trust a 19-year-old medical student with my practice's future?</h3>
            <p><strong>Brutal honesty:</strong> You shouldn't trust me because of my age or credentials. You should trust me because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I have to prove results every month or you fire me (no contracts)</li>
                <li>I've analyzed every dental practice in your market obsessively</li>
                <li>One failed client destroys my reputation before it starts</li>
                <li>Big agencies assign junior staff to your account - with me, you get direct access to the person doing the work</li>
                <li>My medical background means I understand patient psychology and pain points</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Plus:</strong> My guarantee makes this risk-free for you, but career-ending risk for me if I fail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens when medical school gets demanding?</h3>
            <p><strong>Fair concern.</strong> Here's how I handle it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I deliberately limit to 8 total clients (currently at 5) so each gets proper attention</li>
                <li>I work on campaigns during study breaks and evenings when I'm sharpest</li>
                <li>If my schedule ever becomes an issue, I'll transition you to a vetted partner at no cost</li>
                <li>Medical school actually helps - I'm constantly learning about patient psychology and behavior</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This business is paying for my education, so it gets priority attention.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why aren't there testimonials from other US dentists?</h3>
            <p><strong>Because you'd be among my first 8 US clients.</strong> Here's why that's actually an advantage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You get founding member pricing (40% less than future clients)</li>
                <li>You get 100% of my attention instead of competing with 50+ other clients</li>
                <li>Your success story becomes a featured case study</li>
                <li>You help shape the service into exactly what Des Moines dentists need</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What if my practice can't handle 25+ new patients monthly?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Start with emergency and high-value services (root canals, Invisalign)</li>
                <li>Gradually scale up general cleaning and routine appointments</li>
                <li>Raise prices to match demand (premium positioning)</li>
